**Reflection on my first Guided Pairing Session**

Here is a photo of [my pairing partner Mike and I](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kimallen/phase-0-gps-1/master/mikeandkim/mikeandkim.png)

Prior to the pairing session, I felt pretty comfortable with the work flow through version control, so was not struggling with those particular concepts.  I had office hours with Emmanuel earlier in the day that clarified some things.  One clarification was that a branch made from anywhere in a repository will exist in all places in the repository (it's not like a file that is inside of another).  For example, I can create my branch while I am in week-2 directory, but it will exist for any directory inside of phase-0 repository.

I did not know about merge conflicts until this exercise.  It makes sense and a question I probably had anyway.

Questions I asked: Mike used the command git add . to add everything that had been modified, not just a specific file.  I didn't know this syntax so asked and he clarified that.  The guide left before we had gotten to the merge conflict section, so I asked for any key info we might need before moving on to that, since it was a new concept.

What still confuses me is how to remove something that has already been merged on Github.  I think I understand how to undo it on git on my local machine.

I enjoyed my first pairing session on git.  I was somewhat nervous since it was my first one and I didn't know what to expect.  I felt like we communicated well for the most part.  It was easier than I expected as well since it was stuff that we'd already done repeatedly in previous assignments.
